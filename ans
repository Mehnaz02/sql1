define relations and attributes
a relationship in DBMS is the way in which two or more data sets are linked, i.e., any association between two entity types is called a relationship. So entity takes part in the relationship, and it is represented by a diamond shape.

Attributes are objects that are contained in Master Data Services entities. Attribute values describe the members of the entity. An attribute can be used to describe a leaf member, a consolidated member, or a collection



A primary key is the column or columns that contain values that uniquely identify each row in a table. A database table must have a primary key for Optim to insert, update, restore, or delete data from a database table. and it cannot be null.

The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.

A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.

The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.
